Scalability

- Horizontal Scaling is by adding more servers to our existing infrastructure. This can be done easily with MongoDB
because the cost of adding new servers is lesser. And we can do this because of sharding. MongoDB and Cassandra.

- Vertical Scaling is by adding more capacity to the existing server. MySQL.


Reliability
- You have to pay a cost for redundancy to eliminate that single point of failure. Have copies of the same data possibly
on different servers.

Availability
- Something that can be available without a lot of downtime is said to be highly available.
- A system that is highly reliable is always available. But not always vice versa.

Efficiency
- Metrics : Latency (Efficiency/Response time) & Throughput (Number of items delivered in a given time)
- We cannot always estimate system costs because of the changes in network topology, network load, variation in software and hardware components.

Serviceability or Manageability
- If something is hard to service or fix, then availability decreases. 
- Ease of diagnosing, Ease of making updates and modifications, How simple it is to operate the system.
- Early detection of faults help increase availabilty  and reduce downtime.
