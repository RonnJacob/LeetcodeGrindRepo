== INDEXES ==

- Best way to speed up DB performance.
- Goal of indexes is to speed up search of particular table in a DB to make it faster to 
search through the table, and find the row/rows that we want.

Even though indexes can speed up data retrieval, it may itself be large due to 
additional keys which slow down data insertion & update.

If we're going to use a data store for more writing than reading, then indexes decrease
performance due to which we shouldn't use indexes.
